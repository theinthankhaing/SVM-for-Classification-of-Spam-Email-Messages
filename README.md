# SVM for Classification of Spam Email Messages

## Project Overview

* Spam Dataset is used
* Pre - processed data using Standardization
* Created own SVM
* Calculated the Accuracy
* Programming Language - MATLAB

## Environment Setup

* MATLAB

## Procedures

* eval.mat, which contains eval_data and eval_label, is created first to evaluate the created SVM model
* RBF kernel is chosen

* Various sigma values and design parameter values are implemented and tested and chose the values which give highest accuracy
* SVM model is implemented 
* After implementing the model, the model is tested with the data from eval.mat and original data from test.mat file

## The accuracy
